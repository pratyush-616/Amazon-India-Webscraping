# Amazon-India-Webscraping
### What is webscraping?
Web scraping is the automated process of extracting data from websites using programming tools. It involves accessing web pages, parsing their HTML structure, and retrieving specific information such as text, images, or links. Popular libraries for web scraping in Python include BeautifulSoup, requests, and Selenium.

Web scraping is useful for collecting large amounts of data efficiently for purposes like market research, price monitoring, sentiment analysis, or competitive analysis. For example, businesses can track competitorsâ€™ pricing, academics can gather research data, and developers can create applications using real-time data. It provides insights that support data-driven decision-making across various industries.

* Price Monitoring: Track product prices over time to identify trends or find the best deals.
