# Amazon India Webscraping
### What is webscraping?
Web scraping is the automated process of extracting data from websites using programming tools. It involves accessing web pages, parsing their HTML structure, and retrieving specific information such as text, images, or links. Popular libraries for web scraping in Python include BeautifulSoup, requests, and Selenium.

Web scraping is useful for collecting large amounts of data efficiently for purposes like market research, price monitoring, sentiment analysis, or competitive analysis. For example, businesses can track competitorsâ€™ pricing, academics can gather research data, and developers can create applications using real-time data. It provides insights that support data-driven decision-making across various industries.

### Objectives of this project

Web scraping an Amazon India page is useful for several purposes, including:

* Price Monitoring: Track product prices over time to identify trends or find the best deals.
* Market Research: Analyze product categories, top-selling items, and consumer preferences to understand market dynamics.
* Competitive Analysis: Compare product listings, pricing, and reviews to assess competitors' strategies.
* Sentiment Analysis: Collect and analyze customer reviews to gain insights into product feedback and satisfaction.
* Inventory Tracking: Monitor product availability and stock status for e-commerce or affiliate marketing.
* This data enables informed decision-making for businesses, researchers, and consumers.

On plotting the graph of number of products against their brands, we can conclude that the webscraped page consists of shoes dominated by the brands Campus, Asian and Sparx. Upon research we see that these 3 brands of shoes have their origin in India showing that Amazon India does promote national brands while matching the major international shoe brands as well.




2. Categorizing all the shoes on display according to their targetted gender of usage, we get the following plot:

The boxplot generated compares the price distribution across various brands in the dataset, providing a visual summary of the central tendency, variability, and outliers in product prices for each brand.The boxplot effectively highlights differences in pricing strategies across brands and helps identify trends, such as premium brands with higher medians and outliers or budget-friendly brands with lower and more consistent price ranges. We see that brands like Adidas, Campus, Puma and Reebok price their shoes over a wide range making it convenient for consumers to purchase shoes based on their purchasing parity, while other brands may not offer viable pricing options.
